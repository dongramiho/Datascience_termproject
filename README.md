## ðŸ“Œ Project Description

This project analyzes **food waste data** to propose  
effective **reduction strategies** and explore practical **management solutions**.

After preprocessing and cleaning the data,  
**KMeans clustering** is performed on related features to group similar patterns.  
Then, both **Linear Regression** and **LightGBM Regressor** models are applied  
to each cluster for analysis and performance comparison.

Through this approach, the project aims to  
support data-driven policy making and demonstrate the potential of predictive modeling  
in managing and reducing food waste effectively.
